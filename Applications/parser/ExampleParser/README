This package implements the baseline algorithm for example based scene parsing in 
"Jimei Yang, Brian Price, Scott Cohen and Ming-Hsuan Yang, Context-Driven Scene Parsing with Attention to Rare Classes, CVPR 2014"

All the source codes are in the 'code' folder. We provide a demo dataset 'Make3D' in the 'datasets' folder.
Note that we use Gist based image retrieval in this implementation.

To run the demo, please first run 'ConstructDatabase.m' to prepare the database, and then run 'KNNMRF.m' to test the algorithm.

If you have any questions or find any bugs, please email to jimeiyang@gmail.com.
