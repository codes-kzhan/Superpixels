# Superpixels
This is a repo for superpixel research. It contains 4 module; they are algorithms, applications, evaluation and features.

## Superpixel Algorithms
This module contains most of superpixel segmentation algorithms, such as SLIC, Turbopixel, Watershed, and so on, whose code are public avaible. 
## Applications
This module focuse some computer vision application based on superpixels, such as object recognition, surface rescontruction, and so on.
## Evaluation
This module conatins a superpixel benchmark. There are 13 metrics for superpixel evaluation.
## Features
Superpixel feature extraction is important for computer vision application, we build a standalone feature extraction module which contain common superpixel feature extract algorithms, such as SIFT, HOG.
